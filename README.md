# Sliding Window

`sliding-window` attempts to be a flexible tool for performing a sliding window
analysis. A sliding window compute some descriptive statistics over a set of
values within a list of values, and then moves one "step" accross the list
and repeat the process.

The "list" can either be a list of only the values of interest, or also
containing grouping data, positional data, or a combination of these.
